#### Bears, Beets, NLP

This is my current project. In this, I scraped The Office script and am building a series of classifiers to predict which character said which line. I'm writing a series of blog posts outlining challenging and findings. The repository for the project is [here](https://github.com/conleyst/bears-beets-nlp) and the blog posts can be found in the Blog section of my website.

#### Shiny App for Viewing Canadian UFO Sightings

In the project [here](https://github.com/conleyst/canadian-ufo-sightings), I built a Shiny app to view reported Canadian UFO sightings between 1936 and 2014. The dataset I used came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings).

#### Predicting the Popularity of Mashable Articles

This was a mini-project I did to identify what made an article posted on Mashable "popular". The full analysis can be found in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/conleyst/predicting-social-media-shares/blob/master/results/analysis.md).
