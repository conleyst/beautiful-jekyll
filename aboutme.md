title: About me
---

Hello! I'm currently a student in the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. Before entering the program and focusing on data science, I did my MSc in mathematics at McMaster University, where I studied [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic#Model_theory) and [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space).

When I'm not working with data, you can find me hiking, running, or watching basketball!
